== Adding HTTP/HTTPS Channel Security
If your application supports both HTTP and HTTPS, and you require that particular URLs can only be accessed over HTTPS, then this is directly supported using the `requires-channel` attribute on `<intercept-url>`:

[source,xml]
----
<http>
<intercept-url pattern="/secure/**" access="ROLE_USER" requires-channel="https"/>
<intercept-url pattern="/**" access="ROLE_USER" requires-channel="any"/>
...
</http>
----

With this configuration in place, if a user attempts to access anything matching the "/secure/**" pattern using HTTP, they will first be redirected to an HTTPS URL footnote:[For more details on how channel-processing is implemented, see the Javadoc for `ChannelProcessingFilter` and related classes.].
The available options are "http", "https" or "any".
Using the value "any" means that either HTTP or HTTPS can be used.

If your application uses non-standard ports for HTTP and/or HTTPS, you can specify a list of port mappings as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<http>
...
<port-mappings>
	<port-mapping http="9080" https="9443"/>
</port-mappings>
</http>
----

Note that in order to be truly secure, an application should not use HTTP at all or switch between HTTP and HTTPS.
It should start in HTTPS (with the user entering an HTTPS URL) and use a secure connection throughout to avoid any possibility of man-in-the-middle attacks.
