= Hello Spring Security (Boot)

This section covers the minimum setup for how to use Spring Security with Spring Boot.
For how to use Spring Security with Java Configuration, see <<servlet-hello-jc>>.
For how to use Spring Security with XML Configuration, see <<servlet-hello-xml>>.

NOTE: The completed application can be found at {gh-samples-url}/boot/helloworld[samples/boot/helloworld]

== Updating Dependencies

The only step you need to do is update the dependencies by using <<getting-maven-boot,Maven>> or <<getting-gradle-boot,Gradle>>.
For your convenience, you can download a minimal Spring Boot + Spring Security application by https://start.spring.io/starter.zip?type=maven-project&language=java&bootVersion=2.1.2.RELEASE&baseDir=hello-spring-security&groupId=sample&artifactId=sample&name=hello-spring-security&description=Demo+project+for+Spring+Boot&packageName=sample&packaging=jar&javaVersion=1.8&autocomplete=&style=security&style=web&generate-project=[clicking here].

== Starting Hello Spring Security Boot

You can now https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-running-with-the-maven-plugin[run the Spring Boot application] by using the Maven Plugin's `run` goal.
The following example shows how to do so (and the beginning of the output from doing so):

.Running Spring Boot Application

[source,bash]

$ ./mvn spring-boot:run

== Spring Boot Auto Configuration

Spring Boot automatically:

* Enables Spring Security's default configuration, which creates a servlet `Filter` as a bean named `springSecurityFilterChain`.
This bean is responsible for all the security (protecting the application URLs, validating submitted username and passwords, redirecting to the log in form, and so on) within your application.
* Creates a `UserDetailsService` bean with a username of `user` and a randomly generated password that is logged to the console.
* Registers the `Filter` with a bean named `springSecurityFilterChain` with the Servlet container for every request.

Spring Boot is not configuring much, but it does a lot.
A summary of the features follows:

* Require an authenticated user for any interaction with the application
* Generate a default login form for you
* Let the user with a username of `user` and a password that is logged to the console to authenticate with form-based authentication (in the preceding example, the password is `8e557245-73e2-4286-969a-ff57fe326336`)
* Protects the password storage with BCrypt
* Lets the user log out
